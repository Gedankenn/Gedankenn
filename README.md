## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm Fabio, a **Computer Engineer working with R&D-oriented embedded systems**, specialized in **firmware, low-level software, and hardware–software co-design**.

I currently work at **Autenpro**, developing **embedded systems for agricultural machinery**, focused on sensing, automation, and real-time control.

My work and personal projects revolve around:
- turning hardware into real products  
- building reliable firmware from the register level up  
- transforming unclear requirements into working systems.

I’m at home with **oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, datasheets, and Linux terminals.**
